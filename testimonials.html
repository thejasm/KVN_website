<p>I'm currently a practising litigant at the Delhi high court and district courts of New Delhi. After I finished my studies at kailasanadha
									vidyanikethan, I went on to study for a degree in law and management at Sharda University. A BBA LLB (integrated)
									graduate, having continuously achieved academic excellence and completed post-graduation, LL.M in Corporate, Banking,
									and Insurance Law.
									<br/><br/>
									Simple things hold great meaning when they are from their school days. When I think back to some of the earliest times,
									I can only remember tiny sparks and flickers of certain moments. However, at a certain age, I began to remember more
									vividly the events in my life. I remember the first time I set foot in this school back on 2nd June 2012. Unlike other
									schools in Trissur, this school is located on a remote hill set in the backdrop of a forest which provides a cool
									atmosphere throughout the year. The individual attention and care of the faculty in kailasanadha vidyanikethan to each
									student is highly commendable. I was a student of science and was among the third batch of students in kailasanadha
									vidyanikethan. I still remember especially during my first year at kailasanadha vidyanikethan how students were
									struggling with the change.
									<br/><br/>
									I feel privileged to have had such a unique education and faculty, who nurtured my self-confidence and encouraged us to
									learn from our drawbacks and falls. I firmly believe that the surroundings and people of kailasanadha vidyanikethan
									solidified my desire to always rise back from failures and falls. The risks I had taken to begin to move from a position
									of pusillanimous to one of openness, from self- flagellation to something closer to self-acceptance.
									<br/><br/>
									I always remember them with great respect and always be thankful. Some of the great memories of
									friendship, brotherhood, and immense flow of wisdom from great minds in the rustic beautiful
									campus of kailasanadha vidyanikethan. It was with great sadness that I left the threshold of this
									institution and will always remember this institution with fond memories.
									<br/><br/>
									Here I want to pour out my heart but I think that kailasanadha vidyanikethan is such a great school for making you feel
									cared for as an individual, rather than lost in a big crowd and I guess that's something we may not appreciate properly
									until we look back on it. I was able to be utterly and completely myself, not forced into becoming something that I
									wasn't, and encouraged that anything was possible. Hence, I pursued a career that not many thought of. I'm sure this
									stemmed from the core values of the school, not just teaching a curriculum but also a positive way of life. I have so
									many fond memories of my high school years; it's a time in my life that I always cherish.
									We should all cherish our school memories as they can always be our bliss of solitude.</p>

<p>I'm a graduate in B.A. (Hons) in Social Work with Specialization in Rural Development Programme. What a treat it
									is to return to your area of study and give a lecture! Kailasanadha Vidyanikethan. I can still clearly recall the day I
									enrolled here for grades 11 and 12. It was a combined engineering coaching batch. My two years of education have helped
									me to understand the value of several essential lifelines. I gradually realized that my enthusiasm was different from
									engineering. I became aware of this and looked into more courses in the humanities stream. I learned about the
									bachelor's program through the Tata Institute of Social Sciences Tiss! And this course made me feel so much!! I've
									always been interested in society and people. A radical change in the field of study! It was challenging for me to
									persuade my parents that switching from PCM to humanities was worthwhile. This session allowed me to demonstrate my
									skills in a setting where many people are inspired to become engineers or doctors rather than just an opportunity for
									alums to speak.</p>

<p>I am former student of Kailasanadha Vidya Nikethan Mannuthy, and 
									now I am Resident in Neurosurgery in Irkutsk State Railway Hospital Irkutsk Russia
									In November I had an opportunity to talk with my junior students currently studying in KVN. On that day recall the
									influence of the school which lies inside the womb of nature. The life in KVN helps me to mould my life to success. The
									habits I get from there like yoga etc are still an asset to my life. The teachers like Anitha mam and all who discovered
									the talents inside me are the main reason for my success. In my interaction with my students I explained the students
									how my school, Late Purushothaman Sir and Sarala Mam influenced me and my future.</p>

									&lt;&gt;Kailas Anadha Vidyanikethan is the school where I did most of my primary education. I joined there when I was studying
									in 3rd standard and stayed there till I finished my 12th. Roughly 9 years (2005-2014). KVN was a new school when I
									joined, there were only about 10-20 students in most classes. One of the best things about KVN is that most teachers
									were very friendly, almost like family. The fact that there were fewer students in the class, might have actually helped
									in this as well. This also motivated me to study harder. That is when I found out that I am actually good at it. KVN
									also gave me opportunities to try some extracurricular activities like karate, yoga, and music in addition to physical
									training. During my time at KVN, I was also lucky to participate in various higher-level exams like olympiads which were
									also fun. Furthermore, I also got to explore cultural activities like dancing, drama, etc during the cultural fest. Most
									of all, I made some good friends during my time at KVN. I also want to remember some of my favorite teachers in this
									testimonial, Rejitha Miss, Lobo mam, Shobana mam, Rito Sir, Biju sir, Vinesh sir, and Nithin sir. If someone asks me to
									compare KVN with other schools, I can't. First of all, I was not in any other school from the 3rd standard onwards.
									Secondly, as far as I am concerned, today I am happy that I studied at KVN. I don't know if my opinion will be different
									had I got a chance to study in another school. But, no matter where I am, I will always be a student of KVN!
									Thank you very much Kailasanadha Vidyanikethan for making my childhood wonderful!
